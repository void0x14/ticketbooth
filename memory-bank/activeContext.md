# Active Context

## Current Focus
Transitioning the project from a GitHub fork to a standalone repository (`void0x14/ticketbooth`) to ensure active maintenance and independent development.

## Recent Changes
- Renamed the old fork to `ticketbooth-old`.
- Created a new standalone repository `void0x14/ticketbooth`.
- Performed a mirror push (commits, tags, branches) to the new repository via SSH.
- Restoring the `memory-bank` following an accidental deletion.

## Next Steps
1. Verify the state of the new repository on GitHub.
2. Complete the `memory-bank` reconstruction.
3. Commit the new `memory-bank` to prevent future data loss.
4. Continue with planned enhancements (Roadmap).
